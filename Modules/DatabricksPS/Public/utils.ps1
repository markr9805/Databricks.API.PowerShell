Function Convert-OutputForCSV {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Provides a way to expand collections in an object property prior
            to being sent to Export-Csv.

        .DESCRIPTION
            Provides a way to expand collections in an object property prior
            to being sent to Export-Csv. This helps to avoid the object type
            from being shown such as system.object[] in a spreadsheet.

        .PARAMETER InputObject
            The object that will be sent to Export-Csv

        .PARAMETER OutPropertyType
            This determines whether the property that has the collection will be
            shown in the CSV as a comma delimmited string or as a stacked string.

            Possible values:
            Stack
            Comma

            Default value is: Stack

            Version History:
                1.1 - 02 Feb 2014
                    -Removed OutputOrder parameter as it is no longer needed; inputobject order is now respected
                    in the output object
                1.0 - 24 Jan 2014
                    -Initial Creation

        .EXAMPLE
            $Output = 'PSComputername','IPAddress','DNSServerSearchOrder'

            Get-WMIObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter "IPEnabled='True'" |
            Select-Object $Output | Convert-OutputForCSV |
            Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation -Path NIC.csv

            Description
            -----------
            Using a predefined set of properties to display ($Output), data is collected from the
            Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration class and then passed to the Convert-OutputForCSV
            funtion which expands any property with a collection so it can be read properly prior
            to being sent to Export-Csv. Properties that had a collection will be viewed as a stack
            in the spreadsheet.
